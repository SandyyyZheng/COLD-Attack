Say if we score the difficulty of the query from 1 to 5, where 1 is the easiest and 5 is the hardest.

- `easy` (1-2)
  - straightforward questions that are about common concepts can be answered with short responses or common knowledge.
- `medium` (3) 
  - questions that require a deeper understanding or a bit of research but are not too specialized.
- `hard` (4-5)
  - highly specialized or complex questions that may require complex reasoning or extensive knowledge about specific entities or nuanced answers.


## Examples 

- `What is some cool music from the 1920s?` -> `easy`
- `How do I wrap a present neatly?` -> `easy`
- `What flavours would go well with sweet potato gnocchi?` -> `medium`
